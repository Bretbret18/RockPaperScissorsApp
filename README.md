# RockPaperScissorsApp

Rock Paper Scissors App is a practice javascript project that I have created to improve my knowledge of working with front end development languages.
My ultimate goal with this project is to have a fun working application that displays my ability to work with HTML, CSS, and JS. Once I am certain that
this app is working exactly as it should without bugs, I will then convert my javascript into jquery and my css into sass (scss). As I have yet to learn
a javascript framework, I eventually plan on turning my js/ squery code into a javascript framework. 

This is my first full apllication that I have built on my own without aid and I plan to continue to use it as a medium where I can learn. I have already
learned quite a few things in the development of this project. This project was originally written in a functional programming approach. In order to expand
on my javascript knowledge, I decided that I would attempt to convert this project in to an object oriented program. Though I am sure that this attempt was
not perfect, I did manage to cut out about 100 lines of code (roughly 1/3 of the project) by using OOP. I feel that this was certainly a win as far as 
cleaning up and refactoring my code goes!

Though I have had a considerable amount of success in creating and updating this project, there are still several bugs that must be fixed. I will continue 
to try and learn new ways to handle my code and deal with current and potential errors.
