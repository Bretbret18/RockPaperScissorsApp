            The objective of the game is to chose either Rock, Paper, or Scissors and defeat
            the opponent in a best out of 3 match! In case you are not familiar with the 
            rules of this game:
          <div class="rules"> Rock beats Scissors</div>
            <div class="rules">Scissors beats Paper</div>
            <div class="rules">Paper beats Rock</div>
             If you chose the same button as the opponent, the result of the round will be a draw.

              when the round is complete. Once the round is complete, click the next round button! <br>
